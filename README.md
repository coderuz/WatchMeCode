To install on your localhost you would need to install Redis
> Get redis here:

Then:
```sh
clone https://github.com/teamspider/WatchMeCode.git
cd WatchMeCode/src
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Creating and Editing showrooms is incomplete.
You may want to go to hardcoded url for now

Like:
  - localhost:8000/room/myroom
  
Edit:
  - localhost:8000/edit/myroom
